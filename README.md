# Hangman
The game will lead the player to the era from where gaming started. Hangman is one of those oldest games which has been played by almost everyone of us. The player is supposed to guess a word. He will be given 'n' number of tries in order to guess the word right. With every wrong prediction, a part of hangman will be made visible, and if the count of wrong guesses crosses the maximum limit 'n', the man will be entirely hanged to death and the player looses the game. If the player is able to guess the word before the man is hanged completely i.e. before the maximum number of tries 'n' , he wins the game.
